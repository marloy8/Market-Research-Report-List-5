<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Time-Domain Type</li><li>Spectral-Domain Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging Systems are divided into two main types: Time-Domain Type and Spectral-Domain Type. Time-Domain Type systems use a moving reference mirror to scan different depths within the sample, while Spectral-Domain Type systems use a stationary reference mirror and a diffraction grating to separate different wavelengths of light. Time-Domain Type systems are older and less common, while Spectral-Domain Type systems offer faster imaging speeds and higher resolution. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various medical and scientific applications.</p></p>
