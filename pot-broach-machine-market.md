<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pot Broach Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Pull</li><li>Spiral Pull</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pot broach machines are commonly categorized into two main types based on their pulling mechanism: straight pull and spiral pull. In straight pull machines, the broach tool moves in a linear, straight fashion to remove material from the workpiece. On the other hand, spiral pull machines utilize a twisting motion to gradually remove material in a spiral pattern. Both types offer unique benefits depending on the specific application, with straight pull machines typically used for simpler, more straightforward broaching operations and spiral pull machines favored for more intricate and complex workpieces.</p></p>
