<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prenatal DNA Sequencing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Genetic Disorders</li><li>Nonhereditary Disease</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Prenatal DNA sequencing for genetic disorders focuses on identifying genetic abnormalities that may be passed down from parents to the unborn baby. This type of testing is crucial for identifying conditions such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia. On the other hand, prenatal DNA sequencing for nonhereditary diseases involves identifying genetic mutations that may increase the risk of developing conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer. Both types of prenatal DNA sequencing provide valuable information for families and healthcare providers to make informed decisions about pregnancy and future health management.</p></p>
