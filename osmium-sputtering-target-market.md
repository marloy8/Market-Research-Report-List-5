<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Osmium Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Non Rotatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Osmium sputtering targets are commonly used in various industries for thin film deposition processes. Two main types of osmium sputtering targets are rotary type and non-rotatable type. Rotary type targets are designed to spin during the sputtering process, allowing for a more uniform coating on the substrate. Non-rotatable type targets, on the other hand, remain stationary during sputtering. Both types have their specific applications and are chosen based on the desired deposition outcome and equipment compatibility.</p></p>
