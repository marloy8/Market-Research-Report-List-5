<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Blacks for Rubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Black</li><li>Furnace Black</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon blacks are classified into two main types for the rubber market - Thermal Black and Furnace Black. Thermal Black is produced by decomposing natural gas or oil at high temperatures, resulting in smaller primary particles and higher purity. Furnace Black, on the other hand, is produced by incomplete combustion of heavy petroleum products, leading to larger primary particles and lower purity. Thermal Blacks are typically used for high-performance applications requiring good dispersion and conductivity, while Furnace Blacks are more commonly used for general-purpose rubber products.</p></p>
