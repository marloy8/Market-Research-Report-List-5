<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biocoal (Synthetic Coal) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biocoal, also known as synthetic coal, is a renewable energy source that mimics the properties of traditional coal. Two main market types for biocoal production are torrefaction and steam explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating biomass in a low oxygen environment to create a solid fuel with higher energy density and improved grindability. Steam explosion, on the other hand, uses high-pressure steam to break down biomass into a fine powder for energy production. Both methods offer sustainable alternatives to conventional coal.</p></p>
