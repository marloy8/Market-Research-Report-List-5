<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coronary Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stent (BMS)</li><li>Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</li><li>Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coronary stents are devices used to treat blockages in the arteries of the heart. There are three main types of coronary stents on the market: Bare-metal Stents (BMS) which are metal mesh tubes, Drug-eluting Stents (DES) coated with medication to prevent blockages, and Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS) which dissolve over time. BMS are simple and economical, while DES have reduced risk of reblockage. BVS provide support like traditional stents but eventually dissolve, potentially reducing long-term complications.</p></p>
