<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Iron Wire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Galvanized Iron Wire</li><li>Cold Galvanized Iron Wire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Galvanized iron wire is divided into two main types - hot galvanized iron wire and cold galvanized iron wire. Hot galvanized iron wire is coated with a layer of zinc through a hot-dipping process, providing a thicker and more durable coating than cold galvanized iron wire. Cold galvanized iron wire, on the other hand, is coated with a thinner layer of zinc through electroplating, making it more cost-effective but less durable than hot galvanized iron wire. Both types are widely used in construction, agriculture, and manufacturing industries.</p></p>
