<p><ul><li>Temporary Hair Dye</li><li>Semi-Permanent Hair Dye</li><li>Permanent Hair Dye</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hair coloring product market consists of three main types: temporary hair dye, semi-permanent hair dye, and permanent hair dye. Temporary hair dye washes out after just a few shampoos, making it a popular choice for those looking for a short-term change. Semi-permanent hair dye lasts for a few weeks before fading, giving a longer-lasting color change without the commitment of permanent dye. Permanent hair dye provides a lasting color change that requires regrowth touch-ups as hair grows out, offering a more permanent transformation.</p></p>
