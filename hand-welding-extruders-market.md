<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hand Welding Extruders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Welding</li><li>Hot Gas Welding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hand welding extruders cater to two main market types: contact welding and hot gas welding. Contact welding involves pressing two materials together and welding them using heat and pressure. This method is commonly used for joining thermoplastics. On the other hand, hot gas welding uses a stream of hot air to melt the edges of two materials, which are then pressed together to create a strong bond. Both methods are popular in industries like construction, automotive, and manufacturing for their efficiency and durability.</p></p>
