<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Polypropylene Mesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-absorbable Surgical Mesh</li><li>Absorbable Surgical Mesh</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical polypropylene mesh is used in hernia repair surgeries, pelvic organ prolapse, and stress urinary incontinence procedures. Non-absorbable surgical mesh remains in the body permanently and provides long-term support. On the other hand, absorbable surgical mesh disintegrates over time and is gradually replaced by the body's own tissues. Non-absorbable meshes are ideal for permanent reinforcement, while absorbable meshes are suitable for temporary support. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific needs of the patient and the surgical procedure.</p></p>
