<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DC Servo Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brush Motor</li><li>Brushless Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DC servo motors are categorized into two main types: Brush Motor and Brushless Motor market. Brush motors have carbon brushes that transfer electrical current to the rotor, creating magnetic fields and movement. These motors are more cost-effective but require regular maintenance. On the other hand, brushless motors use electronic commutation instead of brushes, offering higher efficiency, precision, and durability. They are ideal for applications where low maintenance and high performance are required, despite being more expensive upfront.</p></p>
