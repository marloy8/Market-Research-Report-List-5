<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Styrene Polymerization Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Inactive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Styrene polymerization inhibitors can be classified into two types based on their activity: active and inactive inhibitors. Active inhibitors work by actively reacting with free radicals in the polymerization process to prevent further chain reactions, thereby inhibiting polymerization. Inactive inhibitors, on the other hand, act by neutralizing the initiator or co-initiator molecules, rendering them inactive and preventing them from initiating the polymerization process. Both types play a crucial role in controlling the polymerization rate and ensuring the desired properties of the final polymer product.</p></p>
