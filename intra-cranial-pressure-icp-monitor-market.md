<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intra-cranial pressure (ICP) monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intra-cranial pressure (ICP) monitors are devices used to measure the pressure inside the skull. There are two types of ICP monitors - invasive and non-invasive. Invasive monitors are inserted directly into the brain tissue or fluid spaces, providing accurate and continuous measurements but carrying risks such as infection. Non-invasive monitors, on the other hand, are placed on the outside of the head and provide less precise measurements but are safer and more convenient for long-term monitoring. Both types of monitors play a crucial role in managing patients with brain injuries or conditions.</p></p>
