<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photocatalytic Nanocoatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Borne</li><li>Solvent-Borne</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photocatalytic nanocoatings refer to coatings that utilize photocatalysis to break down organic compounds and pollutants when exposed to light. There are two main types of photocatalytic nanocoatings in the market: water-borne and solvent-borne. Water-borne nanocoatings are environmentally friendly as they use water as a base, making them non-toxic and easy to clean up. On the other hand, solvent-borne nanocoatings use organic solvents, which can have a higher VOC content and may be more harmful to the environment.</p></p>
