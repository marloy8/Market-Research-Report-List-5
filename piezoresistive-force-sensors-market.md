<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piezoresistive Force Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shunt Mode FSR</li><li>Thru Mode FSR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Piezoresistive force sensors are classified into two main types: shunt mode FSR and thru mode FSR. Shunt mode FSR sensors measure force by monitoring the change in resistance within a piezoresistive material placed in parallel with the load. Thru mode FSR sensors measure force through the change in resistance of a piezoresistive material placed in series with the load. Both types of sensors are commonly used in applications where accurate force measurements are required, such as in industrial automation, robotics, and medical devices.</p></p>
